**DNN Boards** is a task management solution that allows each user to have their own task board or social group members can collaborate within a single board.

Inspired by Trello, this module was created by Chris Patera for the DNN World 2012 training sessions and utilizes the following:
* DotNetNuke 6.2.3 or 6.2.4 (for 6.2.x version): Content Item Enhancements
* DotNetNuke 7.0: Conversion Notes http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/EntryId/3500/Getting-Started-with-Services-Framework-WebAPI-Edition.aspx
